  <h3> This is a cool list that proves that frogs are cool enough to travel via train with you in the winter:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> frogs are swaggy </li>
      <li> frogs need to travel too. They can't just hop and bop all the time</li>
      <li> frogs are an essential part of this ecosysytem and government </li>
    </ul>
    <div id="words">
    <p>Now you might be wondering why I made a web page about frogs on trains</p>
    <p>That's probably a good thing to wonder...</p>
    <p>Frogs are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> cute </li>
      <li> adorable </li>
      <li> and someone needs to be their advocate during the winter when they need transportation</li>
    </ui>
    <p>So think about that next time you are using a train during the winter!</p>
